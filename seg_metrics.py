    r""" The `Jaccard index`_, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient
    (originally coined coefficient de communautÃ© by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for comparing the
    similarity and diversity of sample sets. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets,
    and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:

        class_weights: 1. or list of class weights, len(weights) = C
        smooth: value to avoid division by zero
        per_image: if ``True``, metric is calculated as mean over images in batch (B),
            else over whole batch
        threshold: value to round predictions (use ``>`` comparison), if ``None`` prediction prediction will not be round

    Returns:
        IoU/Jaccard score in range [0, 1]

    r"""The F-score (Dice coefficient) can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall,
    where an F-score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.
    The relative contribution of ``precision`` and ``recall`` to the F1-score are equal.
    The formula for the F score is:
